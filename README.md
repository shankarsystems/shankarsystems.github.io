Repository is for my GSoC-2017 github page http://jithinbp.github.io

For GSoC-17, I worked on several aspects of the Pocket Science Lab Project:

+ [Firmware development of the PSLab](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-firmware) : Code for PIC24E processor written with MPLab IDE and compiled with XC16 compiler.
+ [Hardware design](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-hardware) : Made with [KiCAD](http://kicad-pcb.org/)
+ [Desktop Applications](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-desktop-apps) : My contributions were towards documenting the various apps and using Jekyll to render markdown files via templates . I cross checked a range of experiments in order to create screenshots, made several schematics, and fixed bugs in a few. I also added applications to calibrate the pslab using ADS1115 16-bit ADC module
+ [Python Communication Library](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-python) : Made bug fixes in capture calls. Helped the android team to understand the various function calls during the porting process. Added support for several new add-on modules such as ADS1115, SX1278 LoRa module, MPU925x 10-DOF IMU sensor among others.
+ [remote laboratory](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-remote) : Made a framework for accessing the PSLab remotely. This involves a backend designed with python flask, and a webapp made with ember-cli. A demo of the webapp hosted on [Surge.sh](pslab-remote.surge.sh), and the backend is hosted on [Heroku](pslab-stage.herokuapp.com)

A list of blog posts I wrote elaborating my journey :

+ The PSLab project is inspired from ExpEYES  <http://expeyes.in>
+ FOSSASIA is supporting development and promotion of ExpEYES project since 2014 mainly through Google Summer of Code
